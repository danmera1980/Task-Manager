# My Practice Project

This project is a personal endeavor to practice, learn, and improve my skills in Angular, Typescript, CSS, and Material Design. It serves as a sandbox where I can experiment with different techniques and concepts while building a functional application.

## Description

The project is a web application that allows users to manage tasks. It provides features such as creating new tasks, updating task status, and viewing tasks in a board-like interface. The application uses Angular framework, Typescript language, and Material Design components for the user interface.

## Getting Started

To start the application, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Navigate to the Client directory:
    ```
    cd client
    ```

4. Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Build and run the application:
   ```
   ng serve
   ```

6. Start the temporary backend server
   ```
   json-server --watch db.json
   ```

7. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:4200` to access the application.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Angular project structure. Here are the key directories and files:

- `src/app/core/services`: Includes the Angular services for data management and communication with the server.
- `src/app/core`: Contains shared interfaces and models used across the application.
- `src/app/shared`: Includes reusable components, directives, and pipes.
- `src/assets`: Contains static assets such as images, stylesheets, and configuration files.
- `angular.json`: Angular project configuration file.
- `package.json`: Includes project dependencies and build scripts.
